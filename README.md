## Self Driving Car Simulation
### A project on Reinforcement Learning to simulate a self driving car

- I am attaching my code, dataset link and model weights and checkpoint for you to test it out yourself. Also, attaching a video to determine how the output looks like for the simulation.


- Link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y10Ket-t07pP8zuVF5rjs9wQSfWGWO6d?usp=sharing

- Place the code within the working directory.
- Download the dataset from above provided link and unzip it in your working directory, or link it to your google colab the way I did (just change the path to the dataset).
- Run the code for it to train.

- Once trained, you will have model logs and the model itself within the google drive folder (make sure the path is changed to your needs)

- Download them and run the second file, model_atan.ipynb file to see the model in action.

- Place the steering_wheel_image.jpg in the Dataset folder that you downloaded on your local machine and the models folder within the working directory.
- FYI, you need the dataset in your local machine if you are testing the model in your machine.
- Make sure to fix the path according to your system.

- DrivingTestVideo provides a sample video output of my Project.
